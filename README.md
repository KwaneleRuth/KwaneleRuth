- 👋 Hi, I’m Kwanele Ruth Ndlovu.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, artificial intelligence and cyber threat intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cyber threat intelligence with Mosse Cybersecurity Institute, software engineering with ALX Holberton School and studying to certify as a Security Operations Analyst with Microsoft. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal with using sensors to collect data and employ analytics on this data to come up with intelligent AI solutions.
